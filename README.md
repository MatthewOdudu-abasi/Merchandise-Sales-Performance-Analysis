## 📘 Project Description
This Power BI project explores merchandise sales performance across cities, demographics, and product categories. It visualizes which customer segments and regions are driving sales, offering actionable insights into product demand, marketing impact, and potential inventory optimization strategies.

## ❓ Problem Statement
The company lacked clarity on which products performed best, in which cities, and among which customer groups. This analysis was developed to bridge that knowledge gap and deliver a clear, data-driven dashboard showing who buys what, where, and when.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – For data preparation, cleaning, and structuring
- **Microsoft Power BI** – For dashboard visualization and analysis

## 🔁 Summary of Process
1. Cleaned raw sales records and segmented by age, gender, and geography
2. Standardized inconsistent entries for city and product categories
3. Verified and corrected sales totals
4. Imported into Power BI and modeled relationships between segments
5. Developed visual reports tracking trends, customer group behavior, and regional demand

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Standardized city names and merged similar values (e.g., "NYC" and "New York")
- Removed null or invalid entries for gender, age group, and product types
- Verified total sales data across segments
- Reformatted all numeric and categorical fields for better dashboard integrity

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Total Sales**: 856,000+ units sold overall  
- **Top City**: Sydney led with 48,000 units sold  
- **Top Product**: Clothing represented 74.4% of total sales (637K units)  
- **Best Customer Group**: Youth bought the most (337K units), followed by Adults (286K) and Young Adults (233K)  
- **Gender Breakdown**: Female customers drove 70% of total merchandise sales (600K vs. 256K for males)

## 🔍 Observations
- Sales experience a slight seasonal dip during summer months (June–August), then rebound in Q4  
- Clothing remains the dominant product line across all cities and groups  
- Western cities such as Sydney and San Francisco outperform others  
- Female and youth demographics are consistently top-performing, suggesting effective existing engagement or product alignment

## ✅ Recommendations
1. **Target Youth Demographics**: Launch product lines and marketing campaigns tailored to young buyers  
2. **Boost Q3 Promotions**: Use flash sales or seasonal discounts to counter summer dips  
3. **Expand Clothing Inventory**: Given its share of sales, explore diversification by theme or occasion  
4. **Double Down on Female Buyers**: Add loyalty perks and female-focused product bundles  
5. **Study Underperforming Cities**: Analyze sales in Toronto and Paris for logistical, cultural, or pricing gaps  
6. **Replicate High-Performing Models**: Use Sydney and San Francisco insights to inform strategies in new or lagging regions  
7. **Offer Age-Specific Collections**: Develop targeted merchandise for youth, adults, and seniors
